## Simple Summary

Improvement to LP rewards

## Abstract

We propose:

- Changing the weights for non BTC/ETH markets to `v = 0.6, d = 0.35, and s = 0.05`
- For BTC/ETH, `v = 0.8, d = 0.15, s = 0.05` 
- Reducing the amount paid for BTC/ETH to 10% / 10% rather than 20% / 20%, thus giving 80% to the other markets

The main direction then is to increase weight towards the Volume term that was added last time by Wintermuteâ€™s proposal, as well as acknowledge the maturity of BTC/ETH markets and the lower need there to incentivize book-quoting.

Over time as other markets mature we can move further on towards even more simple volume weighting.

On August 14, there was a Snapshot vote on this which concluded with 505 voters and 22.7M DYDX in agreement (99.95%)- to revise the LP rewards formula and rewards allocation.

## Motivation

Moving towards more sustainable LP rewards that reward liquidity providing where it is actually needed, and increase importance of volume actually done versus other metrics that are indermediary.

## Specification

Weights for non BTC/ETH markets to `v = 0.6, d = 0.35, and s = 0.05`

Weights for BTC/ETH markets to `v= 0.8, d = 0.15, s = 0.05`

Reducing the amount paid for BTC/ETH to 10% / 10% rather than 20% / 20%, thus giving 80% to the other markets

Updates to the LP rewards formula and rewards allocation do not require any smart contract changes. Revisions to the LP rewards formula and rewards allocation will be implemented by dYdX Trading after the start of Epoch 15 (September 27, 2022, at 3 PM UTC). All changes will take effect in Epoch 15.

## Rationale

Making a further step towards incentivizing volume, and focusing on growth markets for rewards rather than developed ones.
