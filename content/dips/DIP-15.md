## Simple Summary

Improvement to LP rewards

## Abstract

We propose:

- Changing the weights for non BTC/ETH markets to `v = 0.6, d = 0.35, and s = 0.05`. 
- For BTC/ETH, `v = 0.8, d = 0.15, s = 0.05` 
- Reducing the amount paid for BTC/ETH to 10% / 10% rather than 20% / 20%, thus giving 80% to the other markets.

The main direction then is to increase weight towards the Volume term that was added last time by Wintermuteâ€™s proposal, as well as acknowledge the maturity of BTC/ETH markets and the lower need there to incentivize book-quoting.

Over time as other markets mature we can move further on towards even more simple volume weighting.

## Motivation

Moving towards more sustainable LP rewards that reward liquidity providing where it is actually needed, and increase importance of volume actually done versus other metrics that are indermediary.

## Specification

Weights for non BTC/ETH markets to v = 0.6, d = 0.35, and s = 0.05.
Weights for BTC/ETH markets to v= 0.8, d = 0.15, s = 0.05 
Reducing the amount paid for BTC/ETH to 10% / 10% rather than 20% / 20%, thus giving 80% to the other markets

## Rationale

Making a further step towards incentivizing volume, and focusing on growth markets for rewards rather than developed ones.
