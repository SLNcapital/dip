## Simple Summary

Updating the Trading Rewards formula to w=fees

## Abstract

The previous Trading rewards formula was overly complex and set a high bar to earn substantial rewards by requiring a participant to have a high Open Interest as well as lots of DYDX tokens.

The snapshot vote concluded with 645 voters and 21M DYDX in agreement (99.13%). The vote results have shown significant support for the program. https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x28193f3cc8f0a1d1a98a7c32ea4cd51b497c27b8de6bdb36208c4fd4883a0c73
